//comments regarding design of data structure



//design will be changed now, to an electronic health system, where concurrent reads are to be
//expected at high velocity, and writes not as often but still require some sort of efficiency

//reading the values, the name and DOB must match to return the ordered list, and then updating values
//when writing
